# MapleRidgeCode-a-thon
Submission for maple ridge code a thon
Will be developing an App according to the following description
The City of Maple Ridge is collaborating with Esri Canada, a leading Geographic Information Systems company, to host this online Code-a-thon. We’re looking for cool new apps, tools, storyboards, etc. that promote the use of open data. Possible entries may include apps that support tourism, provide new services for residents and businesses, or apps that would help our City operate in a more efficient manner. All apps require data, and this data may be sourced from our City’s Open Government Portal at opengov.mapleridge.ca. Although beginners will be welcome, you should have some understanding of what a Code-a-thon is, how to access and use open data, and how to build an application. Participants will be supplied with more details about this competition during the webinar, which will include information about our open data sources, how to get technical support and submission guidelines.
